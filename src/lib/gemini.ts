# ✅ README STRUCTURE AND RULES

## 1. 🧠 Overview
A 2–3 sentence founder-level summary explaining what the project *is*, what problem it solves, and who it's for.
Tone: visionary but grounded.

Example:
> "This repository implements a modular AI inference system designed for real-world SaaS integrations. It combines OpenAI APIs, LangChain orchestration, and scalable Express services to deliver low-latency intelligent responses."

---

## 2. 🚀 Key Features
Bullet points summarizing the system's *capabilities and advantages*, not just features.

Example:

- Modular, testable, and Dockerized backend
- Supports multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Built with scalable architecture for 10K+ concurrent users
- Production-ready CI/CD setup with automatic linting and build pipelines

---

## 3. 🧩 System Architecture
Explain the repo's structure and reasoning behind it.

Include a **Mermaid diagram** showing the overall flow:
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[AI Engine / Model Layer]
    C --> D[Database / Vector Store]
    B --> E[Frontend UI]
\`\`\`

Then explain why it's designed that way:
"The backend isolates AI orchestration logic from transport and storage, allowing independent scaling of each layer."

---

## 4. ⚙️ Tech Stack
List technologies by layer and add why each was chosen.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose / Reason |
|-------|------------|------------------|

| AI / ML | OpenAI API, LangChain | Prompt management and embeddings |
| Database | MongoDB | Flexible schema for dynamic AI outputs |
| Infra | Docker, Vercel | Easy deployment and scalability |

---

## 5. 🧱 Project Structure
Auto-generate a concise structure based on actual codebase:
\`\`\`
/src
  /api         → All REST endpoints
  /ai          → AI orchestration logic
  /components  → UI components
  /db          → Database models and utils
  /utils       → Shared helpers
\`\`\`
Each folder should have a short 1-line explanation.

---

## 6. 🧩 Setup & Installation

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone ${repoInfo?.cloneUrl || "https://github.com/user/repo.git"}

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the app
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Include short notes for environment variables detected in the codebase.

---

## 7. 💡 Usage Examples
Show real-world usage, not "hello world."
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/generate \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"prompt":"Summarize this document"}'
\`\`\`

Example Output:
\`\`\`json
{ "summary": "This document explains..." }
\`\`\`

"You can integrate this endpoint into any product or internal tool to auto-summarize content in real time."

---

## 8. 🧠 Design Philosophy
Add a short section that proves you think like a systems engineer.

"This codebase follows clean modular principles — separating orchestration, inference, and persistence layers. Every design choice favors scalability, testability, and real-world deployment simplicity."

This section differentiates senior developers from juniors.

---

## 9. 📈 Scalability & Extensibility
Use bullet points:
- Modular structure supports multi-model expansion.
- Stateless API layer allows horizontal scaling.
- Can integrate additional providers or databases with minimal refactor.
- Easily containerized for microservice deployment.

---

## 10. 🔐 Security & Reliability
Summarize security and quality measures:
- API keys loaded via env vars only.
- Rate-limiting middleware prevents abuse.
- Request sanitization before AI calls.
- Graceful error handling and retries.

---

## 11. 🧰 Developer Experience
Explain tools that make it easy for contributors:
- ESLint + Prettier configured for consistent code.
- Husky pre-commit hooks for quality control.
- Example .env provided for quick setup.
- CI pipeline auto-runs tests on PR.

---

## 12. 🧾 License

---

## 13. 💬 Author & Attribution
Add clear credit and credibility:
- Author: [Detect from repo or use placeholder]
- Website: [If available]
- Building scalable AI products with modern full-stack and MLOps tooling.

---

## 14. ⚡ TL;DR Summary
End with a single paragraph written for an investor or founder:

"This project is a foundation for real-world AI product development — modular, clean, and production-ready. It demonstrates strong architecture, practical scalability, and craftsmanship expected from top-tier engineers."

---

- Use clear directional arrows: → ← ↑ ↓ ⇄ ⇅ ⤴ ⤵
- Use different box styles for different component types:
  - Rectangles (┌─┐) for services/components
  - Diamonds (◇) or decision boxes (┌─┐ with ?) for decision points
  - Cylinders (╔═╗) or rounded (╭─╮) for databases
  - Double lines (╔═╗) for external services
  - Dashed lines (┌┄┐) for background processes
- Show parallel processes with parallel vertical/horizontal paths
- Include error paths with different symbols (⚠, ✗) or dashed arrows

- Show all intermediate processing steps in the middle
- End with final response/output on the right or bottom
- Use horizontal flow (left to right) OR vertical flow (top to bottom) - choose the clearest
- Group components by layer (Frontend → API → Business Logic → Data Layer)
- Show decision points clearly with Yes/No branches
- Include all error paths and their destinations
- Show async operations with separate parallel flows
- Indicate data transformations and processing steps

2. Do NOT stop after section 10 - you MUST continue to sections 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17
3. Each section must be 5-6 paragraphs (except sections 2, 6, 9, 10, 13 which use tables/lists, and section 17 which has a diagram + 2-3 paragraphs)
4. You have ${maxOutputTokens} tokens available - use them ALL to generate complete, detailed documentation
5. Do NOT truncate or stop early - generate ALL sections from 1 to 17 in order with full detail
6. Sections 11-17 are CRITICAL - they MUST be included with full detail
7. The documentation MUST include these exact section headers:
   - ## 11. 🧩 Extensibility Map
   - ## 12. 🔍 AI Commentary (Senior Engineer Review)
   - ## 13. 💡 Business Applications
   - ## 14. 📊 Roadmap & Growth Potential
   - ## 15. 🧾 License & Deployment Details
   - ## 16. ⚡ TL;DR – Founder Summary
   - ## 17. 🗺️ Complete System Flow Diagram (THIS IS THE FINAL SECTION)
8. Be DETAILED and PRECISE - base everything on actual codebase analysis, no fluff or lies
9. Include specific file paths, function names, and code patterns from the repository
10. Generate sections 1-10 first with 5-6 paragraphs each, then IMMEDIATELY continue with sections 11-16 (also 5-6 paragraphs each), and FINALLY section 17 with comprehensive ASCII art diagram
11. Section 17 MUST include a comprehensive ASCII art diagram showing the complete system flow from start to end - START IMMEDIATELY with the diagram, no text descriptions first
12. Do NOT end your response until section 17 is complete with the diagram and explanation

REMEMBER: Incomplete documentation (missing sections 11-17) is WORSE than shorter but complete documentation. Every section must be detailed and based on actual codebase analysis. Section 17 is the FINAL section and must include a complete ASCII art system flow diagram.`;
